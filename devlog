Devlog 1.5

FINISHED ALL HEBREW REGEX!!!
TAGS:
| Tag | Meaning / Triggered by |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<001>` | `,,a` Aramaic tag detected and removed (`stripAramaicTag`) |
| `<002>` | `--` plus/minus/equals section detected (`stripPlusesTag`) |
| `<003>` | `?` question mark detected (`stripQuestionTag`) |
| `<004>` | `^` caret detected (`stripCarrotsTag`) |

| `<007>` | Not all three Qere patterns found (`moveQereTag`) |
| `<008>` | Curly bracket section detected (`moveCurlyTag`) |
| `<009>` | Angle bracket section detected (`moveAngleTag`) |

original data had more granularity to its tags.
for now this is enough to organize for manual or deterministic review at a later date.
The important thing is that the text is seperated from the tags.
